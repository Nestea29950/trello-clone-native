## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16+)

git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-trello-notifications.git
cd react-native-trello-notifications
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project and add it to your app
   - Create a `firebase.js` file in the `functions/` folder and configure Firebase:

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = firebase.auth();
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
expo start
```

## Usage

### Dark Mode
Toggle between light and dark mode on the Account Screen by simply switching the toggle.

### Notifications
View a list of fake notifications presented in a card format on the Notifications screen. These cards mimic Trello's card style, with shadow effects and smooth scrolling.

### Authentication
Log in and log out using Firebase Authentication. On logout, the user is redirected to the login screen.
